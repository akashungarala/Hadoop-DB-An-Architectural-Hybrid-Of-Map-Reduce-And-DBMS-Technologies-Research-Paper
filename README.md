# Hadoop DB: An Architectural Hybrid of Map Reduce & DBMS Technologies (Research Paper)

Hadoop is not replaced by Hadoop DB. In our research, we tried to show that using an efficient database storage layer reduces data processing time especially on tasks that require complex query processing over structured data such as joins. We also tried to show that Hadoop DB is advantageous in terms of fault-tolerance and has the ability to run on heterogeneous environments which generally comes with Hadoop-style systems. The combination of the two methods would give an output that change the data processing and take it to next generation with high efficiency, minimum or nil node failure and the ability to deal with all kind of data sets.
